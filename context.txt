1. Class and obj(example)
2. Class has data/attribute and func/methods
        > Code walkthrough
        > attribute get called itself, methods are called manually
3. Why Python is called OOPS? -> Everything in Python is an object (data structure,data types) 
4. Advantages of OOPS:
    > You can create your own datatype
    > Code reusability
    > Debugging 
    > Easy to colab

5. End to end project(chatbook)
    > function vs method
    > magic method and dunder method
    > self
    > You can create attribute outside class as well
    > encapsulation
    > getter and setter
    > static method
